# Real-time-Multi-person-Fall-Detection
Human fall has always been a major source of injury among both the aged as well as general population. A large majority of the research till date have focused on single fall detection for the aged. However, the issue of human fall cannot be restricted to a certain age group. Complex situations like traffic accidents may warrant the need for a multi-human fall detection system. Keeping in mind such scenarios, we have developed a multi-human fall detection system, integrating vision-based data collection, the popular human pose estimation model, OpenPose and a novel algorithm for computationally inexpensive and efficient fall detection. The proposed approach was tested on real-life falls instead of simulated falls and has shown promising results for the same. The system can thus be effectively used in a multitude of scenarios and ensure the safety of the monitored people.
